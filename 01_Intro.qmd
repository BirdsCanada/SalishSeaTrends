## Methods {#1.1Intro}

[Details on data collection and processing can be found in the next section of this user guide](#1.1Data).

The analysis framework is spatially explicit, meaning the model borrows strength from data-rich regions to stabilize estimates in areas with sparse sampling. The model uses spatially varying coefficients (SVCs, Gelfand et al. 2003) to account for relationships between variables (in this case, counts of birds) that are not uniform across large spatial areas. This modelling approach was first applied to continent-wide bird abundance data to assess winter bird population trends using discrete aerial units (Meehan et al. 2019) and an intrinsic conditional autoregressive model (iCAR; Besag 1974). Many management units (such as geopolitical boundaries) are divided by discrete polygons, making the iCAR approach desirable to derive robust estimates of annual relative abundance as well as trends for coastal waterbirds in the Salish Sea.

The basic statistical unit for the analysis was the maximum yearly count of each species at a survey site. We initially structured the analysis to use monthly counts at sites as our response variable. However, model diagnostics revealed convergence failures and inflated variance components indicating poor identifiability of monthly effects. To balance temporal resolution with model stability, we aggregated counts to the maximum yearly count at each survey site. This aggregation reduced overdispersion while maintaining ecological relevance.

Species must meet the minimum data requirements in order to be included in the analysis. By default, these include (1) minimum annual abundance \>10 individuals across all sites, (2) detection in \>50% of study years, and (3) presence at \>10 distinct monitoring locations. [Minimum data filters can be adjusted by users before running the analysis](#3.1Analysis).

Extreme outliers in observation counts are identified using a quantile-based threshold. We calculated the outlier cutoff as three times the 99th percentile of the maximum observation count. This was done to prevent disproportionate influence from rare extreme values and to aid in model fit. Data from 2020 were removed to due survey disruptions caused by COVID-19.

We modeled observed bird counts, yat at site a and year t using a negative binomial distribution: yat∼NB(μat,ϕ). The expected count, μat, was modeled on the log scale as follows: log⁡(μat)=log⁡(Dat)+ft+γk+αi+τizt+ϵit

where Dat is the survey duration (included as an offset), ft is a year-specific random effect (modeled as IID), γk is a random intercept for survey route, αi is a spatially structured random intercept for area (using an intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) prior), τi is a spatially structured random slope for area-specific temporal trends (also using an ICAR prior), zt is the standardized year, and ϵit is an unstructured area-year interaction term (IID) to capture local spatiotemporal anomalies.

Abundance indices for each area and year were derived by exponentiating the linear predictor for each posterior sample: Index=exp(ft+γk+αi+τizt+ϵit)

Posterior means and 95% credible intervals were computed across samples to summarize abundance and its uncertainty. Area-specific trends were quantified using the posterior distribution of the temporal slope parameter, τi, with annual percent change calculated as 100×(exp⁡(τi)−1).

The spatial component on abundance αi uses an iCAR approach.

The iCAR approach assigned spatially-structured random intercepts for each provided polygon based on the neighborhood adjacency (1=neighbour, 0 otherwise). This allowed for information on relative abundance and trends to be shared across neighbouring polygons. Values of α(sₐ) came from a normal distribution with a mean value related to the average of adjacent cells and with a conditional variance proportional to the variance across adjacent cells and inversely proportional to the number of adjacent cells. We provide an example using the "Watersheds in the Salish Sea Bioregion" layer from the [Salish Sea Atlas Data](https://salish-sea-atlas-data-wwu.hub.arcgis.com/). Users can [upload a multipolygon spatial layer](#3.1Analysis), which covers part or all of the Salish Sea to run the analysis for the management jurisdictions of interest.

The iCAR model also produces area-weighted composite indices of abundance, where [weights are assigned by the user as being equal or based on the polygon area](#3.1.1Analysis).

For analyses conducted at the guild level, we included an additional species-level random effect, also modeled with an IID, to account for unstructured heterogeneity among species.

## Results {#1.2Intro}

Select model outputs (national and international trends) are accessible through the *naturecounts* R package using the nc_query_table() function. Users will need to request permission to access these tables: naturecounts\@birdscanada.org. The outputs from this analysis provides resource managers with openly accessible annual indices of abundance for model-based management planning.

User generated output will be stored in the `Output` folder in the working directory of this R project.

    "text": "3.1.1 Protocol\nBCCWS data collection protocol can be found online here.\nIn short, surveys have been conducted by volunteers using a standardized protocol and data collection sheets. Shore-based counts are completed monthly on or near the second Sunday of each month from September to April. Surveys are complete within approximately 2 hours of high tide to maximize the opportunity for close observation. All waterbirds observed to a distance of 1 km from the high tide line are counted, except those that fly through without stopping. In the case of larger flocks, numbers are estimated by counting individuals and species in groups and scaling up (see Training Module for Volunteers). Data are entered through a customized online data entry system available on NatureCounts, operated by Birds Canada. Observations are processed using the eBird data filters to flag rare species and high counts during observer data entry, and records are manually reviewed for form accuracy.\nThe data are collected using a standardized protocol, by trained citizen-science volunteers. This standardization is a strength of this data set for making inferences about coastal waterbirds in the Canadian Salish Sea.\n\n\n3.1.2 Data Collected\nObservation counts of waterbirds and raptor seen during a survey are compiled at the scale of the route (i.e., the maximum count per species) on each monthly survey. These observations are divided into inland, near shore (shoreline to 500m out from high tide), off shore (beyond 500m), and total counts. The dataset is not zero-filled.\nAuxiliary Data Collected:\n\nObserver information: observer ID\nSurvey information: time observation started, time observation ended, duration in hours\nSurvey condition: precipitation, % cloud, sea condition, tide state, tide movement, visibility, survey equipment, human activity (all categorical)\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Data Access\nData can be freely accessed through the NatureCounts data download portal or directly through the naturecounts R package. The BCCWS is Access Level 4 dataset, meaning a data request form must be submitted. This is not meant to be a barrier, rather a means of keeping track of who is using the data and for what purposes.\nData are formatted using a standardized schema that is a core standard of the Avian Knowledge Network and which feeds into GBIF. This format is called the Bird Monitoring Data Exchange (BMDE), which includes 169 core fields for capturing all metric and descriptors associated with bird observations.\n\n#Sample code to access BCCWS data from NatureCounts\nBCCWS_BMDE&lt;-nc_data_dl(collection=\"BCCWS\", username = \"YOURUSERNAME\", fields_set = \"extended\", request_id = 12345, info=\"MYREASON\")\n\n#Write raw data to the `Data` folder in working directory\nwrite.csv(BCCWS_BMDE, \"Data/BCCWS_BMDE.csv\", row.names = FALSE)",

Shore-based counts are completed monthly on the first Saturday of each month from October to April. Surveys are completed within approximately 2 hours of high tide to maximize the opportunity for close observation. Surveys are a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 30 minutes per site. All waterbirds observed to a distance of 300 m from the high tide line are counted, except those that fly through without stopping. For large flocks, surveys estimate both the mininum, maximum, and best estimate for the number of individuals. Surveyors are required to attend a short training session with Puget Sound Bird Observatory staff prior to their first survey. Data are entered through a customized online data entry system, available here.\nThe data are collected using a standardized protocol, by trained citizen-science volunteers. This standardization is a strength of this dataset for making inferences about coastal waterbirds in the US Salish Sea.\n\n\n3.2.2 Data Collected\nTotal observation counts of each waterbird species seen during a point survey are recorded, including bearing, distance, and sex ratio. Raptors are recorded separately from the other waterbird species. The dataset is not zero-filled.\nAuxiliary Data Collected:\n\nObserver information: observer name\nSurvey information: time observation started, time observation ended\nSurvey condition: weather, precipitation, sea state, tide movement, visibility, human activity, raptor activity (all categorical)\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Data Access\nAt the time of writing, the data were only accessible by reaching out to the Puget Sound Bird Observatory directly and filling out a data sharing agreement. The data will be sent to you as a .csv flat file which will be suitable for Data formatting and processing. Ensure that you receive all the data for the specified temporal period you are interested in analyzing. This will be needed to allow for proper zero-filling. Place the data in a Data folder in your working directory.\n\n\n3.2.4 Data Format\nThe PSSS is in a different format than the BCCWS, and therefore requires a separate data processing step to wrangle the data into the 169 core fields of the Bird Monitoring Data Exchange (BMDE). The following function will do this step for you.\n\n# Call the function passing the file path into the PSSS_BMDE function\n\nPSSS_BMDE &lt;- psss_to_bmde(\"Data/psss20250603.csv\")",

In turn, these modelling outputs can be used to assess environmental and human-induced mechanisms of waterbird changes and provide a foundation from which to tease apart whether local population fluctuations are a result of true changing abundance or shifts in species distributions over time.\nData users are encourage to review the Transboundary avian data for the Salish Sea user guide, which details addition avian datasets and spatial data layers available for the Salish Sea.",

Users are strongly encouraged to read this section in full before proceeding with an analysis.\nPre-computed annual indices of abundance and trends are available through naturecounts r-package and can be retrieved with the nc_query_table() function. Trend have been generated for BC, WA, BCR-5, and for each survey site that had more than 10-years of data.\nChapter 2: Data Access and Cleaning\nData cleaning and formatting steps are largely done in the background. Data cleaning was vetted by the BCCWS and PSSS program coordinators.

    "text": "2.1 Methods\nDetails on data collection and processing can be found in the next section of this user guide.\nThe analysis framework is spatially explicit, meaning the model borrows strength from data-rich regions to stabilize estimates in areas with sparse sampling. The user can choose from one of two spatially explicit analytical approaches. Both use spatially varying coefficients (SVCs, Gelfand et al. 2003) to account for relationships between variables (in this case, counts of birds) that are not uniform across large spatial areas. This modelling approach was first applied to continent-wide bird abundance data to assess winter bird population trends using discrete aerial units (Meehan et al. 2019) and an intrinsic conditional autoregressive model (iCAR; Besag 1974). The modelling framework was later adapted (Meehan et al. 2024) to incorporate continuous space using a triangulated model mesh and stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE; Lindgren et al. 2022). The benefits of a continuous-space (SPDE) versus a discrete-space (iCAR) models are (1) finer resolution of trends, (2) a better understanding of the range of spatial correlation, and (3) a reduction in boundary effects associated with discrete-space analyses. However, many management units (such as geopolitical boundaries) are divided by discrete polygons, making the iCAR approach appropriate in many instances. We therefore develop workflows which allows for both an iCAR and SPDE SVC approach to derive estimates of annual relative abundance as well as trends for coastal waterbirds in the Salish Sea.\nThe basic statistical unit for the analysis was the maximum yearly count of each species at a survey site. We initially structured the analysis to use monthly counts at sites as our response variable. However, model diagnostics revealed convergence failures and inflated variance components indicating poor identifiability of monthly effects. To balance temporal resolution with model stability, we aggregated counts to the maximum yearly count at each survey site. This aggregation reduced overdispersion while maintaining ecological relevance.\nSpecies must meet the minimum data requirements in order to be included in the analysis. By default, these include (1) minimum annual abundance &gt;10 individuals across all sites, (2) detection in &gt;50% of study years, and (3) presence at &gt;10 distinct monitoring locations. Minimum data filters can be adjusted by users before running the analysis.\nExtreme outliers in observation counts are identified using a quantile-based threshold. We calculated the outlier cutoff as three times the 99th percentile of the maximum observation count. This was done to prevent disproportionate influence from rare extreme values and to aid in model fit. Data from 2020 were removed to due survey disruptions caused by COVID-19.\nWe modeled observed bird counts, yat at site a and year t using a negative binomial distribution: yat∼NB(μat,ϕ). The expected count, μat, was modeled on the log scale as follows: log⁡(μat)=log⁡(Dat)+ft+γk+αi+τizt+ϵit\nwhere Dat is the survey duration (included as an offset), ft is a year-specific random effect (modeled as IID), γk is a random intercept for survey route, αi is a spatially structured random intercept for area (using an intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) prior), τi is a spatially structured random slope for area-specific temporal trends (also using an ICAR prior), zt is the standardized year, and ϵit is an unstructured area-year interaction term (IID) to capture local spatiotemporal anomalies.\nAbundance indices for each area and year were derived by exponentiating the linear predictor for each posterior sample: Index=exp(ft+γk+αi+τizt+ϵit)\nPosterior means and 95% credible intervals were computed across samples to summarize abundance and its uncertainty. Area-specific trends were quantified using the posterior distribution of the temporal slope parameter, τi, with annual percent change calculated as 100×(exp⁡(τi)−1).\nThe spatial component on abundance αi uses an iCAR approach.\nThe iCAR approach assigned spatially-structured random intercepts for each provided polygon based on the neighborhood adjacency (1=neighbour, 0 otherwise). This allowed for information on relative abundance and trends to be shared across neighbouring polygons. Values of α(sₐ) came from a normal distribution with a mean value related to the average of adjacent cells and with a conditional variance proportional to the variance across adjacent cells and inversely proportional to the number of adjacent cells. We provide an example using the “Watersheds in the Salish Sea Bioregion” layer from the Salish Sea Atlas Data. Users can upload a multipolygon spatial layer, which covers part or all of the Salish Sea to run the analysis for the management jurisdictions of interest.\nThe iCAR model also produces area-weighted composite indices of abundance, where weights are assigned by the user as being equal or based on the polygon area.\nFor analyses conducted at the guild level, we included an additional species-level random effect, also modeled with an IID, to account for unstructured heterogeneity among species.",

This is equivalent to the geometric mean of annual growth rates, and is standard with the Canadian Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) analysis. Because the BBS uses a GAM year effect, the smoothing of the annual indices makes the end-point approach more stable as it mitigates the sensitivity of anomalous start/end years.",
